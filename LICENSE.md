## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose, other than making changes or new works based on the software, except as provided in the **Contribution Exception** below.

## Distribution License

You may distribute unmodified copies of the software at no charge, provided that you:

1. Distribute the software under the exact terms of this license
2. Include a complete copy of this license with the distribution
3. Do not modify, alter, or create derivative works of the software for distribution
4. Do not charge any fee for the software, its distribution, or any related services

You may not distribute any modified versions of the software under any circumstances, except by contributing them back to the official repository as specified in the **Contribution Exception**.

## Special Exception

The licensor may grant written exceptions to the distribution restrictions on a case-by-case basis. Any such exception:

1. Must be explicitly granted in writing by the licensor
2. Will specify the exact terms and scope of the exception
3. Does not create any precedent or obligation for future exceptions
4. May be revoked by the licensor with reasonable notice
5. Does not transfer or modify the underlying license terms for anyone else

Requests for special exceptions should be directed to the licensor at the official repository.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Permitted Purpose

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, is use for a permitted purpose.

## Contribution Exception

Notwithstanding the restrictions in **Copyright License**, you may make changes or new works based on the software solely for the purpose of contributing those changes back to the official repository maintained by the licensor.

### Terms of Contribution

Any changes or new works created under this exception:

1. Must be submitted to the licensor for review and approval
2. May not be distributed independently as a modified version of the software
3. Require express written authorization from the licensor before integration into the official repository
4. Automatically grant the licensor all rights to use, modify, and distribute the contribution under any terms the licensor chooses
5. Do not grant you or any third party any additional rights beyond those explicitly stated in these terms

### Clarifications

- You may maintain a private fork of the software solely for developing contributions
- You may not make your fork publicly available if it contains modifications
- You may redistribute the original, unmodified software according to the **Distribution License**
- Submission of contributions does not obligate the licensor to accept, review, or respond
- Rejection of a contribution does not grant you any rights to distribute your changes
- This exception does not permit you to sublicense or grant rights to others

## No Sublicensing or Transfer

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.

These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.

If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Termination and Excuse

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice.

Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Definitions
